Hello there, and welcome to my profile. ðŸ‘‹

I am a Java developer currently focused on developing Minecraft plugins. The first programming language I learnt was C, though I remember very little of it. After that, I moved on to C++, then JavaScript, followed by Python. Eventually, I began working on open-source Java plugins while continuing to learn Java.

If you need help with any plugins, please don't hesitate to reach out to me or open an issue in the relevant project.
